function [x,nbrids] = esvm_get_M_features(boxes, N, neighbor_thresh)
%% Get the contextual "box features" for a set of detection boxes
% Turns a detection box into a contextual feature by stacking the
% scores of nearby (highly overlapping) detections.
%
% INPUTS:
% boxes: K detections from a single image "[K x 12] matrix"
% N: raw number of exemplars (unflipped) "scalar"
% neighbor_thresh: the OS threshold which two boxes must meet
%   to be considered neighbors "scalar"
%
% OUTPUTS:
% x: a [2*N x K]
% nbrids: [1 x K] cell array indicating the raw box ids belonging
%   to each context feature

end

%Get overlaps between all boxes in the set
osmat = getosmatrix_bb(boxes, boxes);

%We count flipped exemplar detections as originating from a new
%exemplar id, thus the flipped boxes get a new exemplar id (EID')
%as follows:
%  EID' = EID + #exemplars
exid = boxes(:,6)';
isflip = boxes(:,7)==1;
exid(isflip) = exid(isflip) + N;

%by adding one to the scores, we effectively get a positive score
%NOTE: this is now done before getting box features
%box_scores = boxes(:,end)+1;

%scores already calibrated
box_scores = boxes(:,end);

for j = 1:K
  friends = (osmat(:,j) >= neighbor_thresh);
  friend_scores = box_scores .* friends;
  
  nbrids{j} = find(friends);
  if sum(friends) == 0
    continue
  end
  
  x(exid(friends),j) = friend_scores(friends);
