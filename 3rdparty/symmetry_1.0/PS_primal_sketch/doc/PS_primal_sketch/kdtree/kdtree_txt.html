 KDTREE Find closest points using a k-D tree.
 
  CP = KDTREE( REFERENCE, MODEL ) finds the closest points in
  REFERENCE for each point in MODEL. The search is performed in an
  efficient manner by building a k-D tree from the datapoints in
  REFERENCE, and querying the tree for each datapoint in
  MODEL. 

  Input :
    REFERENCE is an NxD matrix, where each row is a D-dimensional
    point. MODEL is an MxD matrix, where each row is a D-dimensional
    query point. 

  Output:
    CP is the same dimension as MODEL. There is a one-to-one
    relationship between the rows of MODEL and the rows of CP. The
    i-th row (point) of CP is a row (point) from REFERENCE which
    is closest to the i-th row (point) of MODEL. The &quot;closest&quot;
    metric is defined as the D-dimensional Euclidean (2-norm)
    distance.

  
  [CP, DIST] = KDTREE( ... ) returns the distances between
  each row of MODEL and its closest point match from the k-D tree
  in the vector DIST. DIST(i) corresponds to the i-th row (point)
  of MODEL.

  The default behavior of the function is that the k-D tree is
  destroyed when the function returns. If you would like to save
  the k-D tree in memory for use at a later time for additional
  queries on the same REFERENCE data, then call the function with
  an additional output:

      [CP, DIST, ROOT] = KDTREE(REFERENCE, MODEL) where ROOT
      receives a pointer to the root of the k-D tree.

  Subsequently, use the following call to pass the k-D tree back
  into the mex function:

      [CP, DIST, ROOT] = KDTREE([], MODEL, ROOT)
 
  Note that ROOT is again an output, preventing the tree from
  being removed from memory. 

  Ultimately, to clear the k-D tree from memory, pass ROOT as
  input, but do not receive it as output:

      KDTREE([], [], ROOT)

  New since June 2004: This k-D tree library now handles points
  with dimension greater than 3.
