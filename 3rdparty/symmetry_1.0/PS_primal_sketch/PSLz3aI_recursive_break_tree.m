% bin_tree =PSLz3aI_recursive_break_tree(c_x,c_y,index)
%
% Break a continuous curve into a set of straight line 
% tokens using the procedure described in Lowe's SCEPRO '87 paper. 
% The procedure is recursive and scale invariant.
% At each recursion level it breaks  the curve into two curve segments
% at the point where the curve difference from its straight-line
% approximation is maximal.
% Terminates when either the curve length is too short,
% or the scale-invariant merit value does not increase when further 
% breaking the curve apart.
