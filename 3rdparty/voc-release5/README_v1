== Requirements

- Code for DPM: [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/latent/voc-release5.tgz voc-release5]

== Compilation

Most of the code is in Matlab, which does not require compiliation.
The only function that requires compilation is dt_ramanan.cc for generalize distance transform.
We include precompiled binaries for Mac OS 10.9 and Linux 64 bit.
If you need to compile the file, open Matlab and run:

> mex dt_ramanan.cc 

== Demo

> MUB_Demo.demo1()

> MUB_Demo.demo2()

> MUB_Demo.demo3()

> MUB_Demo.demo4()

== Limitation

This version contains pretrained models and testing code.
Training data and training code will be made available in future release. 


== Citation
