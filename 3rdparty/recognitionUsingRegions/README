1. Run main_train.m for training (an .mat file will be automatically generated).

2. Run test_voting.m to evaluate the detection performance of region-based 
Hough voting only.

3. Run test_detection.m to evaluate the detection performance of voting + 
verification.

4. Pre-computed bounding boxes .mat files for voting only and voting + 
verification are available (det_bboxes_voting.mat and det_bboxes_detection.mat)

5. feat_extraction.m extracts shape contour region features from an image.
