% FILLNAN  - fills NaN values in an image with closest non Nan value
%
% NaN values in an image are replaced with the value in the closest pixel that
% is not a NaN.  This can be used as a crude (but quick) 'inpainting' function
% to allow a FFT to be computed on an image containing NaN values.  While the
% 'inpainting' is very crude it is typically good enough to remove most of the
% edge effects one might get at the boundaries of the NaN regions.  The NaN
% regions should then be remasked out of the final processed image.
%
% Usage:  [newim, mask] = fillnan(im);
%
%   Argument:  im    - Image to be 'filled'
%   Returns:   newim - Filled image
%              mask  - Binary image indicating NaN regions in the original
%                      image.
