                        SVM^struct for MATLAB
                                 V1.2
                            Andrea Vedaldi

This is a patch to Thorsten Joachims (http://www.joachims.org/)
SVM-struct implementation that provides a simple-to-use MATLAB
interface.

OBTAINING:

svm-struct-matlab homepage is
http://www.vlfeat.org/~vedaldi/code/svm-struct-matlab.html. The GIT
repository of the project can be downloaded at
https://github.com/vedaldi/svm-srtuct-matlab.

COMPILING:

To compile this software use the included Makefile. It should work out
of the box on Linux and Mac OS X provided that MATLAB MEX program is
in the command line path. So just issue

> make

The only files that are needed to run the package with MATLAB are
svm_struct_learn.mex* (MEX program) and svm_struct_learn.m
(documentation).

If MEX is not on the command line, the path can be specified as

> make MEX=<MATLABROOT>/bin/mex

where <MATLABROOT> is MATLAB root directory. Finally, it is also
possible to specify manually the architecture

> make ARCH=maci     # Mac Intel 32 bit
> make ARCH=maci64   # Mac Intel 64 bit
> make ARCH=glnx86   # Linux 32 bit
> make ARCH=glnxa64  # Linux 64 bit

To clean the build products use

> make clean     # clean all build but the MEX file
> make distclean # clean all build products

USAGE:

There is only one MATLAB command, i.e. SVM_STRUCT_LEARN. This commands
take as input handles to the function implementing the maximal
constraint violation search, the loss, and the feature map. See
TEST_SVM_STRUCT_LEARN and TEST_SVM_STRUCT_LEARN_KER for example usage
and SVM_STRUCT_LEARN built-in help for further information.

CHANGES:

1.2 - Adds support for Xcode 4.0 and Mac OS X 10.7 and greater
1.1 - Adds Windows support (thanks to Iasonas Kokkinos).
1.0 - Initial public release
